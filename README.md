# Sign-up Form Project


## Introduction

This project is part of my intermediate HTML and CSS course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which aims to provide a comprehensive and practical education for aspiring developers. The objective of this project is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service, allowing me to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired in recent lessons.

## Assignment Overview

### Step 1: Set up and Planning

- I set up a Git repository to manage the project's version control.
- Created HTML and CSS files with initial dummy content to ensure everything is linked correctly.
- Downloaded a full-resolution background image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/an-aerial-view-of-a-lake-surrounded-by-mountains-ToJ5qbCMLo8) by [Spenser Sembrat](https://unsplash.com/@spensersembrat) and credited the creator.
- Chose an external font for the 'logo' section.


### Step 2: Gather Assets

- Incorporated the chosen background image into the design.
- Utilized an external font for the `logo` section.


### Step 3: How To Implement

- Structured the page by scaffolding out its elements.
- Employed a semi-transparent background color for readability behind the logo.
- Used a color `#596D48` similar to tones in the background image for the 'Create Account' button.
- Styled the input fields with light borders and included variations for password inputs and selected inputs.
- Ensured basic desktop responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
- Implemented JavaScript for checking password field matches, or alternatively, validated each field separately.

## Why I Created This Project

I created this project to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by applying them to a practical web development scenario. Building a sign-up form allows me to:

- Gain hands-on experience in structuring and styling web pages.
- Work with external assets like images and fonts.
- Practice responsive design, even though mobile optimization is not required for this project.
- Apply the principles learned in the intermediate HTML and CSS course offered by The Odin Project.

This project not only serves as a learning opportunity but also showcases my ability to create a visually appealing and functional sign-up form.
